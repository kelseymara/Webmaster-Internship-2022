# Weeks One-Four

## Week One I had two days of orientation and career-readiness training this week that consisted of various workshops and trainings that prepared and provided me with general skills needed to succed in the workforce. Some of these topics included financial literacy and development of professional goals. I was only able to attend one day because I was sick. I met some of the other interns who will be working with me and I intitiated creating a discord group chat.

## Week Two This was the first full week of my internship. I met my supervisor and the 2 division webmasters. We got assigned onboarding training modules that are build into the educational content management system they use. One thing my supervisor emphasized was how important it is for the website to be Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Compliant. There is an Accessibility Checker tool built into the content management system that we have to use whenever we create content.
